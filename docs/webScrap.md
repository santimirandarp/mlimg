# Using APIs

We register ourselves and can query the Application database, and get data.

Twitter, Youtube, Soundcloud, Unsplash, WeatherAPI, etc.

APIs are normally available in many languages. Sometimes there are even Unix programs to use.

> API: methods and tools to query & retrieve data dynamically. Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, ... enable developers to access the information they store on their servers; others charge for access to their APIs.

# Web Scraping
We write code to extract data from a webpage. This can be done in Python at least.

> Web Scraping: A lot of data isnâ€™t accessible through data sets or APIs but rather exists on the internet as Web pages. So, through web-scraping, one can access the data without waiting for the provider to create an API.

One way is to manually copy-paste the data, which both tedious and time-consuming.
Web Scraping is the automatic process of data extraction from websites.
