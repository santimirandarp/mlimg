# Crypto Basics

Transform a message so only people with the key can unlock it.

msg, keyph === cipher(keyph)@msg ===> Encrypted message

If we shift one letter the word hi becomes  ij. 
The key is one.

The cipher is the algorithm, and depends on the keyphrase.

Symmetric systems: same key to encode-decode message.

Asymmetric systems like RSA (inventors), use 2 keys: A public key to encrypt the message and a private key to decrypt.
